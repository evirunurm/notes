Methods :

Objects :

x.splice(x,y,z)	--> Replaces an array element with [z]. Returns an array with deleted items.
			x : index.
			y : how many elements. 
			If [z] ommited --> element removes without holes.

x.join()		--> Join an array into a string. No parameters --> with commas.
x.concat() --> Creates a new array by mergin existing arrays / strings, no limit of arrays / strings. Returns new array.
x.slice(x, y) --> Slices out a piece of an array into a new one. 
	x : starting element.
	y : finishing element (optional, else rest of array too) (included).

x.length() --> Returns the length of an array. Always one more than the highest array index.
	[arrayName.length] = "newElement"; --> Adds a new element (newElement) to arrayName.
	delete arrayName[0]; --> Changes the first element to undefined. Leaves holes.

x.push() --> Adds a new element to an array at the end. Returs the new array length.
x.pop() --> Removes the last element from an array. Returns poped out value.

x.shift() --> Removes the first element from an array. Returns the shifted out string.
x.unshift() --> Adds a new element to an array at the beginning. Returs the new array length.
